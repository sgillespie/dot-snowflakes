  # This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular
  # machine, and is used to maintain compatibility with application data (e.g. databases)
  # created on older NixOS versions.
  #
  # Most users should NEVER change this value after the initial install, for any reason,
  # even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.
  #
  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,
  # so changing it will NOT upgrade your system - see
  # https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading for how to actually do that.
  #
  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
  # out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.
  #
  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would
  # make to your configuration, and migrated your data accordingly.
